## American Express Data Analyst Mock Interview

American Express is seeking to optimize its marketing strategies to increase customer engagement. The goal is to understand and predict customer responses to various marketing campaigns to drive higher transaction volumes. These campaigns are defined by a range of parameters, including the type of campaign, the communication channel, and the target demographics.

## Business Problem
In this context, customer engagement is defined as making a transaction within 30 days of a campaign. Therefore, the task at hand is to create a predictive model that can identify potential customers who are most likely to respond to a specific campaign.

The predictive model should use the available customer information (age, occupation, account balance, credit score, etc.) and campaign details to predict the likelihood of a customer making a transaction following a campaign. The model will assist the marketing team in targeting the right customers with the right campaigns, thereby increasing customer engagement and overall transaction volume.

The data science team is expected to:

- Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of customers who are more likely to respond to campaigns.
- Preprocess the data by cleaning, handling missing values, and doing feature engineering to make the data suitable for modeling.
- Choose an appropriate machine learning model for this binary classification problem. The model should handle class imbalance, as most customers might not respond to a campaign.
- Select suitable performance metrics considering the business context and the nature of the data. The metrics should reflect both the model's accuracy and its ability to handle class imbalance.
- Evaluate the model using cross-validation to ensure that it is robust and is not overfitting the training data.
Interpret the model results to provide actionable business insights.
- The success of this project will be measured by the model's performance on the chosen metrics and the actionable insights derived from the model. The ultimate goal is to improve American Express's marketing strategies to boost customer engagement and drive business growth.

## Solution Overview

### Data Manipulation

#### Q1_Answer:
The approach here depends on the exact nature of the inconsistencies. As an example, let's assume that the inconsistencies are due to case differences and white spaces. We will convert all categories to lower case and remove leading/trailing white spaces.

#### Q2_Answer: 

Let's first identify anomalies, and then discuss strategies for handling them.

How we handle these anomalies depends on their nature and number. If there are only a few such transactions and they are clearly errors, we might choose to remove them. However, if there are many such transactions, it might indicate a systematic issue that needs further investigation. Negative transaction amounts could indicate returns or reversals, while transactions in the future could be due to issues with the data collection process. We could fill anomalies with a central tendency measure (mean, median) or predictive imputation, or even leave them as is if the subsequent analysis can handle it.

Here's how we could remove these anomalies.

### Feature Engineering
#### Q3_Answer:
To create such a feature, we could calculate a customer's average transaction amount before and after each campaign, and then compute the difference. However, this will only consider campaigns where the customer had a positive response.

#### Q4_Answer:
One simple way to quantify responsiveness could be to compute the time difference between the campaign and the customer's next transaction. A shorter time difference might indicate a higher responsiveness.

#### Q5_Answer
This is more complex and often not directly possible with transactional data, as the income of a customer is usually not available. However, if we make the assumption that income might be related to spending behavior, we can create a proxy feature that represents the trend in a customer's transaction amounts over time.

This gives us the percentage change in transaction amounts for each customer over time, which can act as a proxy for their income trend.

Note: These are basic examples and actual feature engineering may require more complex computations, including domain-specific adjustments and dealing with noisy data.

### Modeling Metric & Model Selection
#### Q6_Answer
When evaluating a model's performance, we often use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, etc. The choice of metrics depends on the problem at hand.

For example, in a marketing campaign response model, since most of the customers may not respond to a campaign, the data will be highly imbalanced. In this case, accuracy is not a good metric because a model that predicts 'No response' for all customers will still have high accuracy. So we might consider precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC which are more appropriate for imbalanced datasets.

Here's how you can calculate these metrics using scikit-learn.
#### Q7_Answer
Class imbalance is a common problem in machine learning. There are several ways to handle class imbalance:

- Undersampling: Reduce the number of instances in the majority class.
- Oversampling: Increase the number of instances in the minority class.
- SMOTE: Generate synthetic samples in the minority class.
- Use class weights: Provide the model with a higher penalty for misclassifying minority class instances.
Let's assume that we want to use class weights to handle class imbalance in a logistic regression model.


#### Q8_Answer
To ensure your model is not overfitting, you can:

- Use cross-validation: This involves splitting your training data into 'folds' and training/testing your model on different subsets of these folds.

- Regularization: Use L1 (Lasso), L2 (Ridge), or Elastic Net regularization to penalize complex models and prevent overfitting.

- Early stopping: In gradient descent-based algorithms, stop training as soon as the validation error reaches a minimum.

Here's an example of how you can use cross-validation.

In this case, we're using 5-fold cross-validation and the ROC AUC score as the evaluation metric.

### Business Insight
#### Q9_Answer
To determine the effectiveness of campaigns across different demographic groups, we can segment the data by different demographic categories (e.g., age group, occupation, income range) and analyze the average campaign response rate in each segment.

If the response rate varies significantly across different demographic groups, this suggests that certain campaigns are more effective with certain demographics. This information can be used to target future campaigns more effectively, by focusing on demographics that are more responsive to campaigns, or by modifying the campaign strategy for demographics that currently have a lower response rate.
#### Q10_Answer
This question is more strategic in nature and would depend on the specific tactics employed by the competitor. However, we could take inspiration from their strategy and design A/B tests to experiment with similar tactics in a controlled manner.

These could include tactics such as varying the timing of campaigns, the channels used, the messaging, etc. The results of these tests could then be used to refine our own strategy.


#### Q11_Answer
This would typically involve estimating the increase in customer response rate due to the changes suggested, and then converting this increased response rate into a monetary value.


#### Q12_Answer
The risks of implementing these recommendations could include potential negative reactions from customers if the increased marketing activity is seen as intrusive or annoying. To mitigate this risk, it would be important to carefully monitor customer feedback and engagement metrics following the implementation of these changes.

The success of the recommendations could be tracked through key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the response rate, conversion rate, average transaction amount, customer churn rate, and customer satisfaction metrics.

Again, these are generalized responses. The actual analysis and strategies would depend on the specifics of the business and the problem at hand.
